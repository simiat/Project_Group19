### Objectives and methodologies

Our project focuses on different types of **minerals** included in the ArCo knowledge graph, and in particular the category of **silicates**. Our goal is to explore the world of minerals to enrich the knowledge graph with subject-predicate-object triples. As part of the methodology, we used:

- SPARQL query language
- [ArCo Knowledge Graph](http://wit.istc.cnr.it/arco/index.php?lang=en) and its Ontologies
- [DBpedia Knowledge Graph](https://www.dbpedia.org/)
- [GITHUB](https://github.com/) to build the website
- Large Language Models ([ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/) and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/app?hl=it))
- Prompting techniques (Zero-shot, Few-shot, Chain-of-Thought, Generated Knowledge Prompting, Self-consistency)



### What are minerals

Minerals are natural, inorganic solids with a specific chemical composition and an organised atomic structure, forming the basis of rocks with distinct physical properties.​ Silicate minerals, predominant in the Earth’s crust, feature silicon and oxygen and exhibit diverse structural forms like frameworks, chains, sheets, or isolated tetrahedra.​ In our website we will focus on three silicate minerals:

* **Quartz**: Abundant silicate mineral found in crystalline and massive forms, typically clear and colourless but variably coloured due to impurities. ​
* **Topaz**: Silicate mineral forming prismatic crystals in colours like colourless, yellow, blue, pink, and green, influenced by trace impurities and treatments.
* **Zircon**: Nesosilicate mineral known for small, well-formed crystals, high refractive index, and strong dispersion, resulting in exceptional brilliance. Comes in various colours; noted for durability and resistance to chemical weathering.​
